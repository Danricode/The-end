# FinalBase

This is a barebones React Native implementation of Firebase's auth feature.
It follows closely the tutorial given in this link: 
https://blog.logrocket.com/email-authentication-react-native-react-navigation-firebase/ 
by Aman Mittal.
And also my own little aditions such as Touch ID.
The project includes a fully functional connection to Firebase, navigation and the ability to create an account and log in,
the components and pages are well segmented, and you can log in with your freaking thumb.
Feel free to copy the code and use on your own React Native Firebase Project.
